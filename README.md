Traveling is a burden, from packing the bags, booking a ticket or even boarding at the airport. Therefore, if the person manages to save time by booking his ticket online, the whole process would become easier. Flight reservation system has a lot of advantages. To start with, it saves a lot of time. Nowadays, it’s becoming very difficult to multitask during the day, thus imagine that you can eat and reserve a ticket instead of actually driving a certain distance to book a ticket and wasting a lot of time. Saving time is always very important especially for people engaged in business. Also, it saves money since online tickets are usually cheaper since it doesn’t require any expenses as a tourism agency. In addition, the customer may be able to book his ticket at any time since the system is active 24/7. The system presents all airlines with specific details about their flights. The user will be able to choose between different flights in the easiest way possible without having to call a travel agency and ask them a lot of questions at the same time. The application is intended to be used on a phone, which is a device used by almost everyone.  While building the application, we should consider the type of users that will be interested in this application. Our target starts from parents on vacation to businessmen; therefore, we will try to include different airline classes. The flights price would range from middle-class income to high-class income.

The application is easy to use, it is very direct. All the user has to do is sign up to create a account. Then, he can log in to book a flight. The flights will appear as huge icons with pictures of the country of destination. Once user book a flight, he verifies it through a message sent on his phone number. Then, payment is done and reservation is complete. Now, every time the user opens his username, a small reminder will keep showing until the time of his flight. The application is built in a way that no two flights that overlap in time can be booked at the same time. A special feature is that once the user is present in the airport on his day of traveling, he has the right to log in as a passenger checker to verify his arrival. The system would check him in and, thus, his name wouldn’t appear under the function absent in flight... The application is basically managed by the admin, who is the only person that have accessibility to the dashboard.

 If the user already has an account, he will directly log in. However, if the user doesn’t have an account, the user will start by signing up, he will enter all the required data and create an account.  The data are a user name, a password, full name, gender, address, and age and phone number. If the username already exists in the database, an error message will appear, stating that we cannot use this username. Once the username is accepted, the account is activated; the user will be able to log in using his username and password.
 
 Upon logging in, the user will be able to scan all the available flights, presented in the system’s database.

When the user chooses the flight, another interface appears, where filling a form to complete his reservation should complete the registration process. The form includes the username, number of children that will travel, the class of the flight, and if there is another user he want to reserve to. If there are no children coming with the user, he has to put zero. Also, upon choosing the flight, the price of each class will appear in red beneath the box. If the user clicks the box of “other user with you”, the system allows him to reserve for another user by entering the other user’s username, his password, and if there are any children
